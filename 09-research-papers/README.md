# 09 — Research Papers

> **Phase:** 3 | **Timeline:** September–December 2026 | **Status:** ⬜ Not Started

## Goal
Produce original research at the intersection of MCP security and LLM capabilities. Target submission to a workshop (SaTML, NeurIPS ML Safety, USENIX Security).

## Paper Ideas
1. **"Systematic Security Analysis of MCP Server Implementations: Attack Surfaces and Mitigations"**
   - Build on existing CVE work
   - Comprehensive methodology for MCP security auditing

2. **"Can LLMs Autonomously Discover MCP Protocol Vulnerabilities?"**
   - Test if Claude/GPT can find MCP vulns with minimal guidance
   - Interesting intersection of LLM capabilities + security

3. **"Automated Adversarial Testing of MCP Server Implementations Using RL Agents"**
   - Combines Cyber RL project with MCP research
   - Most ambitious, strongest signal
