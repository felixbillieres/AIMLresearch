# 01 — ML Foundations

> **Phase:** 1 | **Timeline:** March–April 2026 | **Status:** 🔄 In Progress

## Objective
Build a solid understanding of machine learning and deep learning fundamentals. Go from zero ML knowledge to being able to read papers and implement models from scratch.

## Curriculum

### fast.ai — Practical Deep Learning for Coders
- 🔗 https://course.fast.ai
- Top-down approach: start with working code, then understand the theory
- **Target:** Lessons 1–4 (image classification, NLP basics, tabular data)

### Karpathy — Neural Networks: Zero to Hero
- 🔗 https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ
- Bottom-up approach: build everything from scratch
- **Target:** Videos 1–4 (micrograd, makemore, building GPT)

### 3Blue1Brown — Neural Networks
- 🔗 https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi
- Visual intuition for how neural nets actually work

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Can explain backpropagation without looking at notes
- [ ] Implemented micrograd from scratch
- [ ] Trained a model using fast.ai and understand each step
- [ ] Can read a simple ML paper and follow the methodology
