# 03 — Reinforcement Learning

> **Phase:** 1 | **Timeline:** May 2026 | **Status:** ⬜ Not Started

## Objective
Learn RL foundations and implement agents that solve classic environments. This directly feeds into the Cyber RL Environment project (folder 06) and is critical for the Anthropic Cybersecurity RL Research Engineer position.

## Curriculum

### OpenAI Spinning Up in Deep RL
- 🔗 https://spinningup.openai.com
- Part 1: Key concepts (MDPs, policies, value functions)
- Part 2: Types of RL algorithms (policy gradient, Q-learning, actor-critic)

### Practical Implementation
- Gymnasium (successor to OpenAI Gym): CartPole, FrozenLake
- Stable-Baselines3: PPO, DQN, A2C on various environments
- Track experiments with Weights & Biases

### Reference: Sutton & Barto
- "Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction" — Chapters 1–6
- 🔗 http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html (free)

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Can explain MDP, policy, value function, Q-learning without notes
- [ ] Solved CartPole with custom implementation
- [ ] Solved FrozenLake with tabular Q-learning
- [ ] Used Stable-Baselines3 to train PPO/DQN agents
- [ ] Experiments documented with metrics and visualizations
