## Key Concepts
**AI is not ML**
-> AI is here to try and mimic human reasoning -> think like a human, understanding natural language, recognizing objects, making decisions, solving problems, and learning from experience
key concepts include:
- `Natural Language Processing` (`NLP`): Enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language.
- `Computer Vision`: Allowing computers to "see" and interpret images and videos.
- `Robotics`: Developing robots that can perform tasks autonomously or with human guidance.
- `Expert Systems`: Creating systems that mimic the decision-making abilities of human experts.

-> ML is a subfield of AI that focuses on enabling systems to learn from data and improve their performance on specific tasks without explicit programming.
There are 3 main types of machine learning:
`Supervised Learning` -> algorithm learns from dataset with a known outcome or label -> image classification, spam detection...
`Unsupervised Learning`: The algorithm learns from unlabeled data without providing an outcome or label
`Reinforcement Learning`: The algorithm learns through trial and error by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback as rewards or penalties.

## Deep Learning (DL)
`Deep Learning` (`DL`) is a subfield of ML that uses neural networks with multiple layers to learn and extract features from complex data. -> very good for unstructured data like images, audio and text
key features:
`Hierarchical Feature Learning` ->hierarchical data representation -> each layer captures abstract features: lower layers detect tectures -> higher layers more complex data like shapes
`End-to-End Learning` -> directly map raw data into desired output withour manual features
`Scalability` -> scale well with large datasets so good for big data

here are some common types of DL
`Convolutional Neural Networks` -> Specialized for image and video data
`Recurrent Neural Networks` -> text and speech
`Transformers` -> natural language processing tasks.
