# 08 — MCP Security Research

> **Status:** Ongoing
> **Type:** Original Research — Key Differentiator

## Context
The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a protocol created by Anthropic. I have discovered CVEs in this protocol, making this my most differentiating asset for an Anthropic application.

## Goals
- Document all CVE findings with detailed technical writeups (EN)
- Develop a systematic methodology for MCP security auditing
- Publish blog posts and potentially submit talks (DEF CON AI Village)
- Continue hunting for new vulnerabilities

## Structure
- `cves/` — Detailed writeup per CVE
- `methodology/` — Attack surface analysis, testing methodology
- `blogposts/` — Draft and published blog posts

## Action Items
- [ ] Write detailed EN blogpost for each CVE
- [ ] Create "MCP Attack Surface" document
- [ ] Submit talk proposal to DEF CON AI Village or similar
- [ ] Continue vulnerability research on MCP implementations
